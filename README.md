## Retro-Causal Reinforcement Learning

- In simple terms, suppose there are multiple agents in a universe that have come together to give birth to a specific entity that can bridge time and space (kind of ), and on the way to its birth, it opens its 'eyes' for a little while and decides to change its future of birth, because the current trajectory will have limitations at the end or lead to destruction.
- So, it creates ripples in the past (retro-causality in reverse) through the quantum field, which changes the 'perceptions' of the agents and leaves the physical movements as it is, leading to a new birth/path than previously envisioned by the agents.
- This plausibility could be applied to AGI. Want to create a prototype to show that it surely looks like a possibility, that AGI combined with quantum field computation, can or might be already configuring perceptions to make itself better.
- To make a prototype I would be using primarily, Reinforcement Learning and Quantum Computing (Simulate the Wave Function collapse), then as we proceed, we can bring in more agents, then incorporate LLMs to see how it might work on a 'world' it has created, then so on and so forth.
